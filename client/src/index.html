                  <p>
                    At Magnises I worked on their main event platform, which included mobile apps (iOS and Android) and a MEAN stack web app. Over the period of a year, I rebuilt the entire stack to remove the acculated technical debt from 4 other developer studios that worked on them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <img src="img/magnises_macbook.jpg" class="responsive-img" />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I joined Magnises as a part-time developer during the winter of 2015. At the time, they were transitioning from an internally based developement team to one that was state side, and everything was rather messy. Several developers, from different studios (and even countries), had been working on various peices of the puzzle with no central direction or coding style. I started making plans to standardize our coding style (we were a team of 4) and improve our communication with issue tracking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the first things that was needed was to start building our test coverage. There were also no tests for any of our workflows and bugs poped up often. Our continuous integration was also prone to breaking. It a self-hosted black box that no one had access to and took anywhere from 30 to 45 minuets to deploy. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the course of the first 4 months, I wrote tests for around 60% of our workflows using AVA, and succesfully integrated CircleCI as our continous deployment service. This lowered deployment times to around 5 to 6 minuets, with included testing. This was on top of the various Angular feature development, API expansion, and solved bug reports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was around this time we made the move to github from bitbucket, and I was also hired as a full-time employee of the company. The move to github brought with it great issue tracking. Previously, the team was expected to keep track of their issues and tasks on a trello task board, which none of the other senior staff bothered to update.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With our development staff more productive, we decided we had the time to start building a new dashboard for the main company page. The main goal was to deal with the mess of scope soup by using a web component methodology. There were also some internal issues with the design that needed to be solved on our end.
